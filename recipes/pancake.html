        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1⁄4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
